        <h1>OwinFramework visualizer configuration</h1>
        <p>The visualizer middleware in the OwinFramework support the following configuration options</p>
        <div>
            <p><strong>Path</strong>&nbsp;is the relative path within your web site where the visualizer will be available.</p>
            <p><strong>Enabled</strong>&nbsp;allows you to turn off the visualizer.</p>
            <p>
                <i>
                    Note that instead of disabling the visualizer, you can place it in the Owin pipeline behind
                    some security checks to ensure that only authorized users can access it. In a future version of
                    this middleware I plan to integrate the Authorization middleware with the visualizer so that you can
                    define the user permissions required to view it.
